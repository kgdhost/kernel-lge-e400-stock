 --- How to Kernel Build

(1) Install Sourcery G++ Lite  toolchain for ARM EABI.
- Visit http://www.codesourcery.com/, download and install the toolchain. 

(2) Execute the following build scripts in the kernel root folder (is an example of a modified config):
- make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi- e0mod-perf_defconfig
- make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi- headers_install
- make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi-

* "-j4" : The number, 4, is the number of multiple jobs to be invoked simultaneously. 

(3) If the kernel is built successfully, you can find the build image at arch/arm/boot
